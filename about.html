	<!-- Information Paragraphs -->
	<p> The college I plan to attend is called the University of Memphis, or the UofM for short.<br> It was founded in 1912 under the title of West Tennessee State Normal School. <br> The UofM is a large school centered in Memphis, Tennessee, and it offers quite a few areas of study to choose from. <br> The campus is a whopping 1607 acres, and teaches over 20,000 students. <br> Its areas to study go up to 250 and beyond that, containing quite a number of unique professors to educate the students. <br> The main reason I plan to attend is due to the closeness of it, and the tuition cost, which is rather low. </p>

	<!-- Information Paragraphs -->
	<p> The career I plan to go into is known as the Web Design field, which is listed under the Computer Science field of study. <br> A type of career in this field is useful in today's society, and can earn 64k to 86k a year. <br> Usually the work in this field can be frantic, and becomes a day revolving around constantly keeping up with the needs of the client. <br> No day will ever be the same when in the working side of this field. <br> A lot of well known companies hire for this field too, such as Google or SquareSpace. <br> I genuinely feel that this study will be good for my life, and end up granting me a good life later on. </p>
